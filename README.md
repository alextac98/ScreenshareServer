# Screenshare Server

This is a project designed to use WebRTC to share a screen to another device. The host webserver runs on the device used to be a display. Other devices can connect to the host device's webpage and share their screen with that webserver.

This is ideal for meeting rooms and/or computers permanently connected to TVs or projectors.f
